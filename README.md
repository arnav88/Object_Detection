# Object_Detection
In this program, I have implemented Object Detection using SSD MobileNetv3

1.OpenCV is used

2.A pre-trained Tensorflow frozen model is used

3.Matplotlib is used for visualization and plotting of images and videos

4.The database used : COCO containing 80 classes

I performed Object Detection in a Video too but the the size of it is too large so I couldn't upload it on Github
